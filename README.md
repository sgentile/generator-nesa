###Node Express SocketIO Angular Yeoman Generator###
This is a yeoman generator designed to replace the [NodeExpressAngularSeed](https://github.com/sgentile/NodeExpressAngularSeed) project I set up to quickly get up and running with Node, Express, Angular, SocketIO - with grunt, yeoman and bower.

Todo: will be creating more options as well as some sub generators.

Notes: designed to be used with yeoman angular-generator (from the client folder)

Install: npm install -g generator-angular
